    <h1>🧠 Building AI Systems with LangChain</h1>
    <p><em>January 2026 · June Hong</em></p>

    <p>
        Large Language Models are impressive — but on their own, they’re incomplete.
        A raw model can generate text, but it can’t reliably solve real problems
        without structure, memory, or tools.
    </p>

    <p>
        That’s where LangChain comes in.
    </p>

    <h2>From Prompts to Systems</h2>
    <p>
        Early LLM experiments often stop at prompt engineering.
        You write a clever prompt, get a good result, and move on.
        That works for demos — not for systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Real applications need more:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Multiple reasoning steps</li>
        <li>Access to external tools and APIs</li>
        <li>State and memory across interactions</li>
        <li>Clear control over execution flow</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        LangChain treats LLMs as <em>components</em>, not magic.
        That mindset aligns closely with how I already build software systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Why LangChain Fits My Background</h2>
    <p>
        Coming from embedded systems and backend architecture, I naturally think in
        terms of pipelines, contracts, and failure modes.
    </p>

    <p>
        LangChain feels familiar:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Chains resemble data processing pipelines</li>
        <li>Agents feel like state machines with tools</li>
        <li>Memory behaves like a constrained cache, not a black box</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Instead of asking, “What can the model do?”, the better question becomes:
        “What responsibilities should the model have — and what should the system
        handle explicitly?”
    </p>

    <h2>What I’m Exploring with LangChain</h2>
    <p>
        My LangChain projects focus on reliability and control, not novelty.
        Areas I’m actively experimenting with include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tool-driven agents for structured tasks</li>
        <li>Multi-step reasoning with explicit checkpoints</li>
        <li>Memory strategies that avoid hallucination loops</li>
        <li>Integration with RAG pipelines and external services</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I’m especially interested in where LangChain breaks —
        latency, cost, context limits, and unexpected agent behavior.
        Those edge cases are where real engineering happens.
    </p>

    <h2>LangChain Is Not the Product</h2>
    <p>
        One important lesson: LangChain itself is not the solution.
        It’s scaffolding.
    </p>

    <p>
        The value comes from how you design the system around it —
        input validation, tool boundaries, fallback logic, and observability.
        Without those, even the best chain becomes fragile.
    </p>

    <h2>Connecting to Physical AI and RAG</h2>
    <p>
        LangChain sits at the intersection of my broader work:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Physical AI</strong> — LangChain agents coordinating
            decisions across edge and cloud systems
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>RAG</strong> — grounding LLM reasoning in real, verifiable data
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Digital Twins</strong> — querying simulations and live telemetry
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In all cases, the goal is the same:
        turn probabilistic models into dependable systems.
    </p>

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <p>
        Next, I’ll dive deeper into Retrieval-Augmented Generation —
        where LLMs stop guessing and start citing.
        That’s where LangChain becomes truly powerful.
